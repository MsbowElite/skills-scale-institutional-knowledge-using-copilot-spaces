# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, from initiation to retrospective, ensuring clear workflows, defined roles, effective communication, and robust quality assurance practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme drives projects through a structured lifecycle that emphasizes clear goals, stakeholder alignment, measurable outcomes, and proactive risk management. Our approach is built on iterative delivery, customer-first thinking, and continuous improvement.

### Project Lifecycle

Projects at OctoAcme follow a structured lifecycle with five key phases:

1. **Initiation** - Define project vision, stakeholders, and high-level goals
2. **Planning** - Break down work into increments, align resources, and prioritize backlog
3. **Execution** - Implement features using project boards and Pull Request workflows
4. **Release** - Deploy with checklists, validation, and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective** - Reflect on outcomes and identify actionable improvements

Each phase begins with a clear charter, includes measurable success criteria, and incorporates continuous risk assessment to keep projects on track.

### Key Workflows

A typical OctoAcme project begins with a **Project One-pager** that articulates the problem, proposed solution, and expected impact. Stakeholder identification ensures the right voices are included from the start. High-level timelines and risk assessments provide early visibility into constraints and dependencies.

During **Planning**, work is decomposed into increments (sprints or milestones), resources are aligned to capacity, and a prioritized backlog is documented. This phase emphasizes clarity on acceptance criteria and definition of done.

**Execution** utilizes project boards for transparency, with robust testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) and continuous integration ensuring quality at every step. The Pull Request workflow enables peer review, automated checks, and traceable changes.

**Releases** are governed by deployment checklists, staged rollouts, and documented rollback procedures. Post-release validation confirms expected behavior in production.

**Retrospectives** close the loop, capturing lessons learned, celebrating successes, and prioritizing actionable improvements for future projects.

### Core Roles and Personas

OctoAcme projects succeed through clear ownership and collaboration among key roles:

- **Project Managers (PM)** - Coordinate delivery, manage risks, facilitate communications, and remove blockers
- **Product Managers (PdM)** - Define product vision, prioritize features, establish success metrics, and represent customer needs
- **Developers** - Implement features, write tests, participate in code reviews, and ensure technical quality
- **QA/Testing** - Validate quality through manual and automated testing, verify acceptance criteria, and report defects
- **Stakeholders** - Provide domain expertise, approve decisions, and validate outcomes

Each role has distinct responsibilities documented in our [Roles and Personas](#roles-and-personas) guide, ensuring everyone understands their contribution to project success.

### Communication Strategies

Effective communication keeps projects aligned and stakeholders informed:

- **Daily Standups** - Quick sync on progress, blockers, and daily priorities
- **Weekly Syncs** - Deeper review of sprint progress, upcoming work, and risk mitigation
- **Monthly Updates** - Executive summaries for leadership and broader stakeholders
- **Structured Escalation** - Clear paths for raising and resolving issues that require attention

Communication artifacts include risk registers, project dashboards, status reports, and retrospective notes. These reinforce transparency and enable data-informed decisions.

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is embedded throughout the development lifecycle:

- **Unit Tests** - Validate individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests** - Verify interactions between components and services
- **End-to-End Tests** - Simulate real user workflows and scenarios
- **Automated CI** - Run tests automatically on every commit and pull request
- **Manual QA** - Human validation for major features, UI/UX, and edge cases

Code reviews, security scanning, and performance testing further ensure that only high-quality, reliable code reaches production.
